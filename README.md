# StickyNotes

StickyNotes is a dynamic website that you created using several technologies such as CSS, Bootstrap, Servlet, JSP, Java, Hibernate, and MySQL. It allows users to add new notes, view all notes, edit or delete notes, and organize their daily tasks in a simple and effective way.

The website's design is created using CSS and Bootstrap, which provides a modern and user-friendly interface for the users. The website's backend is built using Servlets and JSPs, which allows for dynamic web pages and provides an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the website.

The website's data is stored in a MySQL database, which is managed by Hibernate, a powerful and flexible Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework. Hibernate allows you to map the database tables to Java objects, making it easy to manage and manipulate data in your application.
